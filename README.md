# Descriptive_Statistics_IBM_Watson_Studio

This Project provides the platform on how to load Database into IBM Db2 cloud and do exploratory Data analysis with three datasets. Here I used Structured Query Language (SQL) to do the query for getting different statistics related to Chicago Crime, Census and Public school Data. At the beginning, I needed to open an account in IBM Cloud to get access to IBM Db2 instance. I loaded the three datasets into IBM Cloud through IBM DB2 instance as three database tables. I needed to take the credential service information such as user name, password, host name to make a link with Jupyter notebook. Then I got access into three tables through Jupyter notebook and the platform becomes easy to use SQL commands to do the exploratory analysis of Data among three Data sets.    


-Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?
-Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?
-Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?
-What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes?
