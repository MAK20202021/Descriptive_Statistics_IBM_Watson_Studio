# Descriptive_Statistics_IBM_Watson_Studio

This Project provides the idea to analyze the descriptive statistics of house pricing dataset. This project belongs to Boston housing dataset. For Data Visualization I used matplotlib and seaborn libraries. To find out the relationship among different entities I did statistical analysis and solved the following questions: 

-Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?
-Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?
-Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?
-What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes?
